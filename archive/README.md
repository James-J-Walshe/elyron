# AI Business Process Digitization Agent - Architecture & Implementation Guide

## System Overview

The AI Agent will transform handwritten business process diagrams into a complete digital ecosystem with full traceability from high-level processes down to individual test cases.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Image Processing & OCR Layer
- **Computer Vision Model**: Custom trained model for recognizing flowchart symbols (rectangles, diamonds, circles, arrows)
- **OCR Engine**: Advanced OCR (Tesseract + custom ML model) for handwriting recognition
- **Shape Detection**: Algorithm to identify process steps, decision points, start/end nodes
- **Flow Analysis**: Logic to trace process flows and relationships between elements

### 2. Process Model Generation
- **Semantic Parser**: Converts OCR text into structured process elements
- **Flow Validator**: Ensures logical flow consistency
- **Element Classifier**: Categorizes elements (task, decision, subprocess, etc.)
- **Relationship Mapper**: Creates parent-child relationships between process elements

### 3. Unique Identifier System
```
Process ID Format: PROC-[ProcessName]-[Version]
Step ID Format: STEP-[ProcessID]-[StepNumber]
Requirement ID Format: REQ-[StepID]-[ReqNumber]
Test Case ID Format: TC-[ReqID]-[TestNumber]

Example Hierarchy:
PROC-CustomerOnboarding-v1.0
├── STEP-PROC-CustomerOnboarding-v1.0-001 (Collect Customer Info)
│   ├── REQ-STEP-001-001 (Data Collection Requirement)
│   │   ├── TC-REQ-001-001-001 (Valid Data Entry Test)
│   │   └── TC-REQ-001-001-002 (Invalid Data Handling Test)
│   └── REQ-STEP-001-002 (Validation Requirement)
└── STEP-PROC-CustomerOnboarding-v1.0-002 (Verify Documentation)
```

## Implementation Components

### Component 1: Image Analysis Engine

**Technology Stack:**
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV + Custom CNN model
- **OCR**: Tesseract + Google Vision API + Custom handwriting model
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch/TensorFlow for custom models

**Key Functions:**
```python
class ProcessImageAnalyzer:
    def extract_shapes(self, image) -> List[ProcessElement]
    def recognize_text(self, image) -> Dict[str, str]
    def map_relationships(self, elements) -> ProcessFlow
    def validate_flow_logic(self, flow) -> ValidationResult
```

### Component 2: Process Digitization Engine

**Output Formats:**
- **Miro Integration**: Via Miro REST API
- **LucidChart Integration**: Via LucidChart API
- **Native Format**: JSON/XML schema for process definition

**Schema Example:**
```json
{
  "process": {
    "id": "PROC-CustomerOnboarding-v1.0",
    "name": "Customer Onboarding",
    "version": "1.0",
    "steps": [
      {
        "id": "STEP-PROC-CustomerOnboarding-v1.0-001",
        "name": "Collect Customer Information",
        "type": "task",
        "description": "Gather required customer details",
        "role": "Customer Service Rep",
        "inputs": ["Customer Contact", "Documentation"],
        "outputs": ["Customer Profile"],
        "business_rules": ["All mandatory fields required"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Component 3: Document Generation Engine

**Word Document Structure:**
1. Process Overview
2. Process Flow Diagram
3. Detailed Step Documentation
4. Role Definitions
5. Business Rules
6. Input/Output Specifications
7. Requirements Traceability Matrix

**Confluence Integration:**
- Auto-page creation with template
- Embedded diagrams
- Linked requirement pages
- Version control integration

### Component 4: Requirements Generation Engine

**User Story Template:**
```
As a [extracted role from process step],
I want [derived goal from step description],
So that [inferred business value from context]

Example:
REQ-STEP-001-001: As a Customer Service Representative,
I want to collect and validate customer information through a structured form,
So that we can ensure complete and accurate customer profiles for onboarding.
```

**Requirements Analysis Logic:**
- Extract actors/roles from process steps
- Infer goals from step descriptions and business rules
- Generate business value statements from process context
- Link requirements to specific process steps via IDs

### Component 5: Test Case Generation Engine

**Given-When-Then Format:**
```
TC-REQ-001-001-001:
Given a Customer Service Rep is collecting customer information
When they enter valid customer details in all mandatory fields
Then the system should accept the information and proceed to verification step

TC-REQ-001-001-002:
Given a Customer Service Rep is collecting customer information
When they attempt to submit with missing mandatory fields
Then the system should display validation errors and prevent submission
```

**Test Generation Logic:**
- Positive test cases for normal flow paths
- Negative test cases for validation rules
- Edge cases based on business rules
- Integration test cases for process handoffs

## Advanced Features

### 1. Interactive Refinement System
After initial processing, the system prompts for:
- **Form Screenshots**: Parse UI elements to refine data requirements
- **Screen Mockups**: Extract field validations and business rules
- **Supporting Documentation**: Additional context for requirement details
- **Stakeholder Input**: Role clarifications and business rule details

### 2. Change Management & Traceability
```python
class TraceabilityManager:
    def track_change_impact(self, changed_element_id) -> ImpactAnalysis
    def update_dependent_artifacts(self, change) -> UpdateResult
    def generate_traceability_matrix(self) -> TraceabilityMatrix
    def validate_completeness(self) -> CompletenessReport
```

### 3. Quality Assurance Features
- **Consistency Checker**: Validates process flow logic
- **Completeness Validator**: Ensures all steps have requirements and tests
- **Standards Compliance**: Checks against business analysis best practices
- **Review Workflow**: Stakeholder approval process for generated artifacts
